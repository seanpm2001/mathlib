# Volume forms and measures on inner product spaces

A volume form induces a Lebesgue measure on general finite-dimensional real vector spaces. In this
file, we discuss the specific situation of inner product spaces, where an orientation gives
rise to a canonical volume form. We show that the measure coming from this volume form gives
measure `1` to the parallelepiped spanned by any orthonormal basis, and that it coincides with
the canonical `volume` from the `measure_space` instance.
